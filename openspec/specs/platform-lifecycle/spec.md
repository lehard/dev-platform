# Platform Lifecycle Specification

## Purpose

The platform lifecycle SHALL define safe, agent-driven task execution from synchronization through publication while preserving OpenSpec contract coherence and avoiding routine human Git hand-offs.
## Requirements
### Requirement: GitHub-aware task lifecycle

The platform SHALL fetch and compare the configured remote integration branch before starting work and again immediately before publication. It SHALL abort rather than auto-resolve divergent histories and SHALL never force-push.

#### Scenario: Remote main advances before start

- **WHEN** local main is clean and behind origin/main
- **THEN** the platform fast-forwards local main before creating task work

#### Scenario: Remote main diverges before publication

- **WHEN** local and remote integration history are not in a safe ancestor relationship
- **THEN** publication aborts and requires explicit reconciliation

### Requirement: Configurable publication modes

The platform SHALL support `pr` and `direct` publication modes. PR mode SHALL publish a feature branch and create or reuse a GitHub PR; its completion behavior SHALL be controlled by `pr_merge_mode=auto|manual`. Direct mode SHALL publish only a safe fast-forward of an integration branch that is explicitly not protected.

#### Scenario: Project uses PR publication

- **WHEN** `publish_mode=pr` and validated feature work is completed
- **THEN** the platform pushes the feature branch and creates or reuses a PR
- **AND** follows the configured PR merge policy

#### Scenario: Project uses direct publication

- **GIVEN** `protected_main=false`
- **WHEN** `publish_mode=direct` and the integration branch safely descends from current origin/main
- **THEN** the platform may push the fast-forward update and SHALL abort on divergence

### Requirement: Composable workflow profiles

The platform SHALL provide `light`, `standard`, and `multi-agent` profiles from one template. Worktrees and the agent board SHALL only be mandatory for `multi-agent`.

#### Scenario: Single-agent project uses light profile

- **WHEN** a project selects `light`
- **THEN** it can use OpenSpec, checks and GitHub lifecycle without mandatory worktrees or agent-board coordination

#### Scenario: Concurrent agents use multi-agent profile

- **WHEN** a project selects `multi-agent`
- **THEN** isolated worktrees and machine-local scope coordination are part of the workflow

### Requirement: OpenSpec contract coherence

For non-trivial OpenSpec work, agents SHALL update planning artifacts before knowingly implementing changed intent, observable behavior, technical design, or execution order. Semantic OpenSpec verification and project-specific checks SHALL be completed before archive.

#### Scenario: Implementation discovers a different solution is required

- **WHEN** the intended behavior or implementation direction changes during an active OpenSpec change
- **THEN** the corresponding proposal, delta spec, design or tasks artifact is updated before implementation knowingly diverges

#### Scenario: Non-trivial OpenSpec change is completed

- **WHEN** implementation tasks are finished
- **THEN** project checks and semantic OpenSpec verification occur before the change is archived

### Requirement: Deliberate learning promotion

Platform friction SHALL remain local unless explicitly promoted. Promotion SHALL omit raw evidence by default, sanitize obvious credential-like content, and require an explicit authenticated action.

#### Scenario: Reusable friction is promoted

- **WHEN** an agent identifies a recurring platform-level problem and an authenticated promotion is explicitly requested
- **THEN** only sanitized structured evidence is sent to the central platform inbox

### Requirement: Workflow profile and harness ownership are composable

The platform SHALL treat workflow profile and lifecycle implementation ownership as independent configuration dimensions. `multi-agent` SHALL describe required capabilities, while `harness_mode=project` SHALL allow a downstream repository to satisfy those capabilities through its own reviewed implementation.

#### Scenario: Mature project provides its own multi-agent lifecycle

- **GIVEN** `workflow_profile=multi-agent` and `harness_mode=project`
- **WHEN** an agent starts or finishes work
- **THEN** platform-owned start/finish wrappers SHALL direct the agent to the repository-owned lifecycle described by project rules instead of requiring platform worktree/board implementations
- **AND** platform doctor SHALL validate only the project-required lifecycle files declared by the reviewed project contract plus common platform files

#### Scenario: Platform provides multi-agent lifecycle

- **GIVEN** `workflow_profile=multi-agent` and `harness_mode=platform`
- **WHEN** platform doctor validates the repository
- **THEN** the platform-managed worktree, board and Git-hook files remain mandatory

### Requirement: Protected integration branches use remote PR integration

A platform-owned lifecycle SHALL NOT publish directly to an integration branch declared as protected. Protected-main publication SHALL use a feature branch and GitHub pull request so required status checks remain authoritative.

#### Scenario: Protected main is configured with direct publication

- **GIVEN** `protected_main=true`
- **AND** `harness_mode=platform`
- **WHEN** doctor or finish preflight evaluates `publish_mode=direct`
- **THEN** the lifecycle fails before local integration or remote push
- **AND** it explains that protected main requires PR publication

#### Scenario: Protected task is ready to publish

- **GIVEN** `protected_main=true`, `publish_mode=pr`, and `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **WHEN** validated feature work is finished
- **THEN** the platform pushes the feature branch, creates or reuses its PR, waits for required checks, merges through GitHub, and synchronizes local main afterward
- **AND** it never force-pushes or bypasses branch protection

### Requirement: Automatic task PR merge preserves zero-hand-off delivery

PR publication SHALL support an automatic task merge policy that completes ordinary agent work after required GitHub checks pass, while retaining an explicit manual-review policy. Temporary check-registration delay and repository-supported async merge policy SHALL be handled inside the same lifecycle invocation. Required-check registration and terminal state SHALL be determined from structured GitHub state for the current PR head, not from human-readable CLI message matching.

#### Scenario: Required checks are not registered immediately

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **AND** the task PR was just created or updated
- **WHEN** structured GitHub state shows that required checks for the current PR head are not registered yet
- **THEN** the platform waits for check registration for a bounded period
- **AND** continues waiting for the required checks once they appear
- **AND** does not require a manual rerun solely because registration was delayed within that bound

#### Scenario: Required-check registration wait expires

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **WHEN** the bounded registration wait expires before required checks are visible for the current head
- **THEN** the PR and feature branch remain intact
- **AND** local main remains unchanged
- **AND** the lifecycle reports a resumable remote-pending state rather than inferring failure from CLI text
- **AND** rerunning the same task finish operation re-queries authoritative remote state

#### Scenario: Structured required check fails

- **GIVEN** required checks are registered for the current PR head
- **WHEN** structured GitHub state reports a required check in a failing terminal state
- **THEN** the platform does not merge the PR
- **AND** local main remains unchanged
- **AND** the failing required check is reported without relying on arbitrary log text

#### Scenario: Merge queue remains pending past the bounded wait

- **GIVEN** GitHub accepted auto-merge or merge-queue enrollment
- **WHEN** the bounded merge confirmation wait expires before the exact task PR reaches `MERGED`
- **THEN** the platform does not begin local-main reconciliation
- **AND** leaves the PR available for GitHub to continue processing
- **AND** a later rerun checks whether the exact task head has since merged and resumes safely

#### Scenario: Automatic task PR succeeds

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **WHEN** required PR checks succeed and GitHub accepts an ordinary protected merge
- **THEN** the platform confirms the PR is `MERGED`
- **AND** updates the local integration copy to the merged remote state
- **AND** completes normal board/worktree cleanup

#### Scenario: Repository requires auto-merge or merge queue

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **AND** required PR checks have succeeded
- **WHEN** GitHub rejects the ordinary merge form because repository policy requires asynchronous auto-merge or merge-queue enrollment
- **THEN** the platform tries supported non-bypass auto/queue merge forms
- **AND** waits for GitHub to report the PR as `MERGED` for a bounded period
- **AND** does not use an administrative bypass

#### Scenario: Automatic task PR check fails

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **WHEN** a required PR check fails
- **THEN** the platform does not merge the PR
- **AND** local main remains unchanged
- **AND** the agent receives the failing-check result

#### Scenario: Manual task PR is requested

- **GIVEN** `pr_merge_mode=manual`
- **WHEN** the task is published
- **THEN** the platform creates or reuses the PR and stops without merging it

### Requirement: Remote merge precedes local integration for protected-main work

For PR publication, local integration branch mutation SHALL occur only after the remote PR has been successfully merged. A confirmed GitHub merge SHALL remain authoritative even if later local or remote-branch cleanup reports a non-zero convenience error. In platform-owned multi-agent PR mode, the shared integration checkout mutation phase SHALL be serialized through the configured integration lock.

#### Scenario: Two task PRs merge near the same time

- **GIVEN** two independent multi-agent task PRs have both been confirmed `MERGED` by GitHub
- **WHEN** both finish processes attempt local reconciliation against the same integration checkout
- **THEN** only one process mutates the integration checkout at a time
- **AND** each process re-fetches remote main after acquiring the integration lock
- **AND** both tasks may complete without Git/index lock races or manual synchronization solely because of concurrent reconciliation

#### Scenario: First reconciliation advances local main before second acquires the lock

- **GIVEN** task A reconciles and advances local main while task B waits for the integration lock
- **WHEN** task B acquires the lock
- **THEN** task B re-fetches and recomputes local-main versus remote-main state
- **AND** safely fast-forwards or accepts an already-equal state
- **AND** does not assume the pre-lock local-main observation is still current

#### Scenario: Remote wait is still in progress

- **WHEN** a task is waiting for required checks, auto-merge, or merge-queue completion
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT hold the shared integration lock during that remote wait

#### Scenario: Remote PR merge is rejected

- **WHEN** GitHub rejects every supported non-bypass merge form because protection requirements are not satisfied
- **THEN** the feature branch and PR remain available
- **AND** local main remains at its pre-publication commit

#### Scenario: Merge is confirmed but cleanup fails

- **WHEN** GitHub reports the task PR as `MERGED`
- **AND** remote branch deletion or local worktree/branch cleanup fails
- **THEN** the lifecycle treats the task as remotely merged
- **AND** continues safe local-main reconciliation where possible
- **AND** reports cleanup as a warning rather than redefining the merge as failed

### Requirement: Publication prerequisites fail early

Platform-owned PR publication SHALL validate GitHub CLI/API availability before work reaches the remote merge stage, and credential resolution SHALL fall back from invalid process token variables to other validated persistent GitHub credentials without requiring routine re-login.

#### Scenario: Stale environment token shadows persistent credentials

- **GIVEN** `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is present but invalid
- **AND** a valid persistent `gh` login or reusable Git HTTPS credential exists
- **WHEN** platform PR publication resolves GitHub API authentication
- **THEN** it ignores the invalid token source after validation fails
- **AND** continues with the valid persistent credential
- **AND** does not require the user to run `gh auth login` again

#### Scenario: GitHub CLI is unavailable or unauthenticated

- **GIVEN** `harness_mode=platform` and `publish_mode=pr`
- **WHEN** all supported GitHub CLI/API credential sources fail validation
- **THEN** doctor/finish fails with an actionable authentication/setup message
- **AND** no local-main integration is attempted

### Requirement: Git branch publication is independent from PR API operations

The platform SHALL treat pushing a validated feature branch and performing GitHub PR API operations as separate publication steps.

#### Scenario: Direct invocation lacks PR API authentication

- **WHEN** a validated feature branch can be pushed using git credentials but GitHub PR API authentication is unavailable
- **THEN** the platform may leave the branch safely published
- **AND** it reports that PR creation/merge is incomplete
- **AND** it does not mutate local main

### Requirement: Protected-main publication is resumable after remote merge

The platform-owned finish lifecycle SHALL recognize a task PR that was already merged by GitHub and SHALL resume only the remaining local reconciliation steps instead of requiring the feature branch to be republished or rebased. The resumed local reconciliation SHALL use the same integration serialization as a first-pass successful PR finish.

#### Scenario: Already-merged retry races another task reconciliation

- **GIVEN** a task PR is already merged for the exact local task head
- **AND** another task is currently reconciling the shared integration checkout
- **WHEN** the first task is retried
- **THEN** it waits for the integration lock rather than mutating the checkout concurrently
- **AND** re-fetches remote main after acquiring the lock
- **AND** completes idempotent local/board/worktree reconciliation without creating a second PR or requiring a rebase

#### Scenario: Process stops after GitHub merge before local synchronization

- **GIVEN** a task feature branch still exists locally
- **AND** its GitHub PR is already `MERGED`
- **AND** `origin/main` no longer has the feature branch as an ancestor because the PR was squash-merged
- **WHEN** the agent reruns `finish_task`
- **THEN** the platform recognizes the already-merged PR before applying stale-branch rejection
- **AND** synchronizes local main to the merged remote state
- **AND** reconciles board/worktree cleanup according to normal options
- **AND** returns success without creating a second PR or requesting a rebase

### Requirement: Task intake preserves managed and quick execution paths

The platform lifecycle SHALL distinguish planned managed work from small direct quick work before implementation begins. A Development Backlog issue explicitly supplied as the task source SHALL use managed-task intake and OpenSpec preflight. A small task directly requested by the user MAY enter the existing execution lifecycle without first creating a central backlog issue or ceremonial OpenSpec.

#### Scenario: User explicitly supplies a managed backlog task

- **WHEN** the user asks the agent to take a supported Development Backlog issue
- **THEN** the agent uses managed-task intake to materialize/verify the referenced OpenSpec planning contract before implementation
- **AND** does not ask the user to restate the already captured product decision

#### Scenario: User gives a small direct fix

- **WHEN** the requested work is a small scoped change that does not require a product/architecture contract
- **THEN** the agent may use the existing task start/check/finish workflow directly
- **AND** does not create a central Development Backlog issue solely to record short-lived work

#### Scenario: Quick task becomes non-trivial

- **WHEN** implementation reveals that a quick task requires a material behavior, architecture, compatibility, data-contract or scope change
- **THEN** the agent stops before knowingly broadening the contract
- **AND** proposes escalation to a managed task/OpenSpec instead of silently continuing as a quick fix

### Requirement: Repository OpenSpec becomes canonical after managed import

A Development Backlog package SHALL be treated as a planning handoff, not as a permanent parallel implementation plan. Once a managed package has been successfully materialized, repository-local OpenSpec SHALL be the canonical contract used by implementation, verification and archive lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Imported change is being implemented

- **GIVEN** a managed package has been materialized successfully
- **WHEN** implementation discovers that intent, observable behavior, technical design or execution dependencies must change
- **THEN** the repository-local OpenSpec artifacts are updated according to the existing no-silent-divergence rules
- **AND** implementation does not repeatedly overwrite them from the original backlog package

#### Scenario: Human views the backlog during implementation

- **WHEN** the managed task is in progress
- **THEN** the central issue remains the human workflow/provenance item
- **AND** it is not treated as a second task list competing with `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md`
