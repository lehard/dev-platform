# agent-workflow Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-systematic-bug-diagnosis-protocol. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Unknown defects use evidence-first diagnosis

Dev Platform SHALL provide a reusable diagnosis path for unknown bugs, regressions and unexplained failures that establishes an observable failure condition and tests falsifiable hypotheses before claiming a root cause.

#### Scenario: Unknown failure is investigated
- **WHEN** an agent is diagnosing an unknown bug or regression
- **THEN** it establishes a reproducible or otherwise directly evidenced failure condition before claiming root cause
- **AND** tests bounded falsifiable hypotheses before applying the final production fix

#### Scenario: Failure cannot be reproduced or evidenced
- **WHEN** the reported failure condition cannot be reproduced or otherwise confirmed
- **THEN** the agent reports the diagnosis as unconfirmed
- **AND** does not present a plausible hypothesis as proven root cause

### Requirement: Diagnosis closes with regression evidence where feasible

When a reasonable test seam exists, diagnosis SHALL produce a regression check that demonstrates the defect before the fix and passes after the fix, and SHALL re-run the original failure path after repair.

#### Scenario: Reasonable regression seam exists
- **WHEN** the diagnosed defect can be captured by a bounded automated test
- **THEN** the test demonstrates failure before the repair and success after it
- **AND** the original reproducer is re-run after the repair

#### Scenario: No reasonable regression seam exists
- **WHEN** capturing the defect requires disproportionate or invalid test coupling
- **THEN** the limitation is recorded explicitly rather than fabricating regression evidence
