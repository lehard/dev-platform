# Completion Lifecycle Specification

## Purpose

The completion lifecycle SHALL make semantic OpenSpec verification and archive part of the agent-owned definition of done for non-trivial work, so completed changes cannot silently remain active or depend on the human user remembering cleanup steps.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Completed OpenSpec changes cannot remain active at publication

For non-trivial OpenSpec work, the platform SHALL treat a change with a completed task checklist as not publishable until the change is archived.

#### Scenario: Completed active change blocks finish

- **GIVEN** an active OpenSpec change with one or more task checkboxes
- **AND** every task checkbox is complete
- **WHEN** the agent runs the platform completion or publication flow
- **THEN** the flow fails with an instruction to verify and archive the change

#### Scenario: In-progress active change is allowed

- **GIVEN** an active OpenSpec change with at least one incomplete task
- **WHEN** lifecycle hygiene is checked
- **THEN** the change is not treated as stale solely because it is active

### Requirement: Archive requires semantic verification evidence

The supported platform archive entrypoint SHALL require a successful semantic OpenSpec verification receipt before archiving a non-trivial change. Agents SHALL prefer `/opsx:verify` when available; environments without that workflow MAY perform the documented equivalent review across completeness, correctness, and coherence.

#### Scenario: Verified change archives

- **GIVEN** all implementation tasks are complete
- **AND** `verification.md` records an exact standalone `OpenSpec-Verify: PASS`
- **AND** `verification.md` records a truthful non-empty `Verification-Method`
- **AND** strict OpenSpec validation succeeds
- **WHEN** the agent invokes the platform archive entrypoint
- **THEN** OpenSpec archives the change and global strict validation is run

#### Scenario: Missing or failed verification blocks archive

- **GIVEN** a completed change has no PASS verification receipt or no documented verification method
- **WHEN** the agent invokes the platform archive entrypoint
- **THEN** archive is refused without mutating the change

### Requirement: Agents own the whole lifecycle

Repository-wide agent instructions SHALL define semantic verify, archive, and configured publication as part of completing non-trivial OpenSpec work so the human user is not expected to remember or relay those steps.

#### Scenario: Agent reports completion

- **WHEN** an agent reports a non-trivial OpenSpec task as complete
- **THEN** project checks, semantic verification, archive, and configured publication have already been completed or any blocking exception is stated explicitly

### Requirement: Unfinished automatic delivery remains explicit completion work

For a platform-owned task configured for automatic PR delivery, an agent SHALL NOT report the task as fully delivered while its exact task PR is still open/pending or while GitHub has merged it but safe local reconciliation remains incomplete. Completion/doctor status SHALL derive that condition from current Git/GitHub state and identify the supported next operation without requiring the human user to remember a Git hand-off.

#### Scenario: Automatic PR is still waiting remotely

- **GIVEN** local validation and OpenSpec lifecycle work are complete
- **AND** the exact task PR is still open, checking, auto-merge armed, queued, or otherwise pending
- **WHEN** the agent reports task status
- **THEN** it describes delivery as unfinished/recoverable rather than complete
- **AND** identifies normal finish/status as the supported continuation path

#### Scenario: Remote PR merged but local reconciliation remains

- **GIVEN** GitHub reports the exact task PR as `MERGED`
- **AND** local integration/board/worktree reconciliation is still pending
- **WHEN** completion status runs
- **THEN** it reports remote delivery complete but local completion work pending
- **AND** does not ask the human to manually reconstruct publication history

#### Scenario: Publication reaches an actionable blocker

- **WHEN** required checks fail, GitHub authentication/state is unavailable, the exact head changed, or repository policy requires an explicit branch update
- **THEN** the agent may stop automatic delivery
- **AND** reports the specific blocker and preserved remote/local state
- **AND** does not misrepresent the task as successfully delivered
