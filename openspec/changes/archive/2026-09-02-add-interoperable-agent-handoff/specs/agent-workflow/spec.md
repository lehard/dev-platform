## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Work can be continued through an optional interoperable handoff

Dev Platform SHALL support an optional, provider-neutral navigation envelope for
continuing live work in another agent, provider, or human context without
duplicating canonical task state, materialized only through the shared optional
engineering capability lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Context moves to another agent, provider, or person
- **WHEN** live work must continue in a context that cannot be reached by an ordinary same-context compact
- **THEN** the envelope identifies repository, exact revision, applicable workspace, managed task/OpenSpec, the provider routing record when one exists, canonical evidence, verified facts, unresolved assumptions, blockers, and next intent

#### Scenario: Same-context compaction is sufficient
- **WHEN** work remains in the same context
- **THEN** no durable handoff artifact is required

#### Scenario: No separate lifecycle is introduced
- **WHEN** the handoff capability is provided
- **THEN** it consumes the shared optional-capability identity, provenance, opt-in, materialization, and update/removal surfaces
- **AND** introduces no handoff-specific registry, configuration, or update lifecycle

### Requirement: Handoff preserves truth and freshness

A handoff SHALL keep verified facts distinct from assumptions, and the receiver
SHALL validate referenced identity before relying on the envelope.

#### Scenario: Revision or task identity changed
- **WHEN** the repository revision or managed task identity referenced by the envelope no longer matches current state
- **THEN** the handoff is treated as stale and canonical sources are re-read before work continues

#### Scenario: Claim lacks evidence
- **WHEN** a statement in the handoff is not supported by cited evidence
- **THEN** it is recorded as an unresolved assumption and is not presented as a verified fact

#### Scenario: A canonical reference is missing or unresolvable
- **WHEN** a referenced canonical artifact cannot be located at the given revision
- **THEN** the receiver surfaces it as a missing reference rather than proceeding on the envelope's prose

### Requirement: Handoff grants no authority and does not duplicate routing

Creating or receiving a handoff SHALL NOT start work, grant write access, or
mutate managed task, OpenSpec, GitHub, or Project state, and SHALL compose with
the existing provider routing handoff rather than replace it.

#### Scenario: Receiving a handoff
- **WHEN** an agent or person receives a handoff envelope
- **THEN** no work is started and no lifecycle, GitHub, or Project state changes until execution is explicitly requested through the normal managed entrypoints

#### Scenario: Creating a handoff
- **WHEN** an agent produces a handoff envelope
- **THEN** it only records navigation context and performs no branch, worktree, commit, comment, or status mutation

#### Scenario: Executor selection is already owned by routing
- **WHEN** a managed task already has a provider routing record
- **THEN** the handoff references that record and does not restate executor selection or write containment or launch an executor
