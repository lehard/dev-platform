## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Task intake preserves managed and quick execution paths

The platform lifecycle SHALL distinguish planned managed work from small direct quick work before implementation begins. A Development Backlog issue explicitly supplied as the task source SHALL use managed-task intake and OpenSpec preflight. A small task directly requested by the user MAY enter the existing execution lifecycle without first creating a central backlog issue or ceremonial OpenSpec.

#### Scenario: User explicitly supplies a managed backlog task

- **WHEN** the user asks the agent to take a supported Development Backlog issue
- **THEN** the agent uses managed-task intake to materialize/verify the referenced OpenSpec planning contract before implementation
- **AND** does not ask the user to restate the already captured product decision

#### Scenario: User gives a small direct fix

- **WHEN** the requested work is a small scoped change that does not require a product/architecture contract
- **THEN** the agent may use the existing task start/check/finish workflow directly
- **AND** does not create a central Development Backlog issue solely to record short-lived work

#### Scenario: Quick task becomes non-trivial

- **WHEN** implementation reveals that a quick task requires a material behavior, architecture, compatibility, data-contract or scope change
- **THEN** the agent stops before knowingly broadening the contract
- **AND** proposes escalation to a managed task/OpenSpec instead of silently continuing as a quick fix

### Requirement: Repository OpenSpec becomes canonical after managed import

A Development Backlog package SHALL be treated as a planning handoff, not as a permanent parallel implementation plan. Once a managed package has been successfully materialized, repository-local OpenSpec SHALL be the canonical contract used by implementation, verification and archive lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Imported change is being implemented

- **GIVEN** a managed package has been materialized successfully
- **WHEN** implementation discovers that intent, observable behavior, technical design or execution dependencies must change
- **THEN** the repository-local OpenSpec artifacts are updated according to the existing no-silent-divergence rules
- **AND** implementation does not repeatedly overwrite them from the original backlog package

#### Scenario: Human views the backlog during implementation

- **WHEN** the managed task is in progress
- **THEN** the central issue remains the human workflow/provenance item
- **AND** it is not treated as a second task list competing with `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md`
