## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Expensive validation requires a fresh task base

For platform-owned task execution, the lifecycle SHALL refresh its observation of the configured remote integration branch and verify that the current task head is based on the authoritative remote history before running expensive full/protected validation intended as delivery evidence.

#### Scenario: Task remains fresh before full validation

- **GIVEN** the current task head contains the freshly fetched `origin/<main>` in its ancestry
- **WHEN** full/protected validation is about to begin
- **THEN** the lifecycle continues with the existing selected validation commands
- **AND** no additional human action is required solely for freshness

#### Scenario: Remote main advances during task execution

- **GIVEN** the task began from an earlier integration state
- **AND** `origin/<main>` has advanced so the current task head no longer contains that authoritative history
- **WHEN** expensive full/protected validation is requested
- **THEN** the lifecycle stops before executing that expensive validation set
- **AND** reports a resumable rebase/reconciliation-first outcome with the observed relationship
- **AND** does not automatically reset, force-rebase, or force-push the task branch

#### Scenario: Freshness cannot be established

- **WHEN** the remote integration state required for authoritative freshness cannot be observed
- **THEN** the lifecycle does not claim the task is fresh for delivery-evidence validation
- **AND** returns an explicit safe blocker/retry outcome rather than silently proceeding

#### Scenario: Task is reconciled and retried

- **GIVEN** a stale task has been safely reconciled onto the current authoritative integration history
- **WHEN** the freshness check is repeated
- **THEN** it succeeds if ancestry is now valid
- **AND** the ordinary validation lifecycle resumes without a second special workflow

### Requirement: Task start establishes an explicit freshness observation

Platform-owned task start SHALL establish the authoritative remote integration observation used to create or resume task work, in addition to existing project synchronization and rollout preflight behavior.

#### Scenario: Task starts after normal synchronization

- **WHEN** the platform has completed its ordinary start sync/preflight
- **THEN** the task starts only from a deterministically observed current remote integration state
- **AND** later freshness checks can compare the task head against a newly refreshed observation without relying on a stale local remote-tracking ref
