## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Repeated managed rollout failures against the same project are surfaced to a human

The platform SHALL maintain a durable, cross-run record of consecutive terminal `blocked` managed-rollout attempts per project, independent of any single ephemeral workflow run. When that count reaches a fixed threshold, the platform SHALL escalate beyond the existing per-attempt annotation into a distinct, labeled, human-discoverable alert. The record SHALL reset the next time that project's rollout preparation succeeds.

This tracking layer SHALL be strictly additive: a failure inside it SHALL NOT change rollout's own pass/fail result for the current attempt, SHALL NOT retry, push, merge, or affect PR-creation, and SHALL NOT modify any existing safety guard, recovery eligibility, or credential scope.

#### Scenario: First failure against a project opens a tracking record
- **GIVEN** a project has no open rollout-failure tracking record
- **WHEN** its managed rollout preparation reaches a terminal blocked state
- **THEN** a new durable tracking record is created for that exact project
- **AND** its consecutive-failure count is `1`
- **AND** no alert-threshold escalation occurs yet

#### Scenario: Repeated failures increment the same tracking record
- **GIVEN** a project already has an open rollout-failure tracking record with a readable prior state
- **WHEN** its managed rollout preparation reaches another terminal blocked state
- **THEN** the existing record's consecutive-failure count increments by exactly one
- **AND** the record retains which release first failed and is updated with the most recent failure's category and reason
- **AND** no second tracking record is created for the same project

#### Scenario: Consecutive failures cross the alert threshold
- **GIVEN** a project's tracking record reaches a consecutive-failure count of 3
- **WHEN** the platform updates that record
- **THEN** the record is labeled as an outstanding alert
- **AND** a distinct workflow warning annotation identifies the project, the streak length, and the tracking record
- **AND** the underlying rollout attempt remains in its original failed state

#### Scenario: A successful rollout resets the streak
- **GIVEN** a project has an open rollout-failure tracking record
- **WHEN** that project's managed rollout preparation next succeeds
- **THEN** the tracking record is closed with a note of how many consecutive failures preceded the resolution and at which release it resolved
- **AND** the record is not deleted, remaining as a historical entry
- **AND** a subsequent new failure against that project opens a fresh record starting at a consecutive-failure count of `1`

#### Scenario: A successful rollout with no prior open record is a no-op
- **GIVEN** a project has no open rollout-failure tracking record
- **WHEN** that project's managed rollout preparation succeeds
- **THEN** the platform makes no tracking-record change

#### Scenario: Prior tracking state cannot be read
- **GIVEN** a project has an open rollout-failure tracking record whose state cannot be parsed
- **WHEN** another terminal blocked attempt occurs against that project
- **THEN** the platform treats the streak as already at or above the alert threshold rather than resetting it to a lower count
- **AND** escalates as in the threshold-crossing scenario
- **AND** does not silently discard the unreadable prior record

#### Scenario: The tracking layer itself fails
- **GIVEN** a rollout attempt has already reached a terminal status
- **WHEN** creating, reading, or updating the durable tracking record fails for any reason
- **THEN** that failure is surfaced as a visible warning in the run's own output
- **AND** it SHALL NOT change the rollout attempt's already-determined success or failure result
- **AND** it SHALL NOT retry, push, merge, or otherwise act beyond the tracking record itself
