## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automatic PR publication reconciles from exact observed state

Platform-owned automatic PR publication SHALL be restartable by re-observing the exact task branch/head and GitHub PR/check/merge state instead of depending on an uninterrupted foreground process or replaying prior phase events.

#### Scenario: Existing exact-head PR is resumed

- **GIVEN** `harness_mode=platform`, `publish_mode=pr`, and `pr_merge_mode=auto`
- **AND** an open PR already exists for the configured base and exact local task head SHA
- **WHEN** the agent runs normal finish again
- **THEN** the platform reuses and reconciles that PR
- **AND** does not create duplicate delivery work solely because the previous publisher stopped

#### Scenario: Existing PR head differs from validated local head

- **GIVEN** the local task head was validated as A
- **WHEN** the candidate GitHub PR resolves to head B
- **THEN** the platform refuses to treat that PR as publication of A
- **AND** it does not merge B under the validation decision for A

### Requirement: Automatic merge intent is exact-head guarded and durable when GitHub supports it

For an exact-head automatic task PR, the platform SHALL prefer to persist merge intent in native GitHub auto-merge / merge-queue state before entering a long local wait. Every protected merge request SHALL include an exact expected task-head guard.

#### Scenario: Auto-merge is armed before required checks finish

- **GIVEN** native GitHub auto-merge is available
- **AND** required checks for exact head A are still pending
- **WHEN** the platform publishes the task PR
- **THEN** it requests auto-merge for A before waiting for all checks locally
- **AND** GitHub may complete the merge after the publisher process exits, provided protections pass and the head remains A

#### Scenario: Exact head changes before GitHub accepts merge

- **GIVEN** validation covered A
- **WHEN** a protected merge operation observes a different PR head
- **THEN** the merge request fails closed through expected-head semantics
- **AND** the changed head must be validated separately

#### Scenario: Native auto-merge is not available

- **WHEN** repository capability/policy does not allow the platform to persist remote automatic merge intent
- **THEN** the existing bounded foreground required-check and protected-merge path remains available
- **AND** the task remains safely resumable through the same exact branch/PR
- **AND** status reports degraded remote durability rather than claiming durable remote execution

### Requirement: Existing published PR recovery is distinct from first-publication freshness

The platform SHALL preserve the existing fresh-base prerequisite for first publication while allowing an already-existing exact-head task PR to continue through GitHub protection after the base advances. It SHALL NOT silently rewrite the candidate branch during recovery.

#### Scenario: Base advances after exact PR was opened

- **GIVEN** an exact-head task PR already exists
- **AND** the configured base advances before merge
- **WHEN** normal finish runs again
- **THEN** it re-observes the existing PR before applying first-publication stale-base rejection
- **AND** GitHub required checks / branch protection / merge queue determine whether integration may proceed

#### Scenario: Repository requires candidate branch update

- **GIVEN** an existing exact-head PR cannot integrate because repository policy requires an updated branch
- **AND** no supported queue/automatic integration path can satisfy that policy
- **WHEN** recovery runs
- **THEN** it reports the branch-update requirement as an actionable blocker
- **AND** it does not silently mutate/rebase the task head

### Requirement: Task publication status is read-only

Platform-owned publication SHALL expose a supported status operation derived from current Git/GitHub state. The status operation SHALL not perform publication or local integration mutations.

#### Scenario: Status observes an unfinished remote task

- **WHEN** an exact task PR is open, waiting, armed, queued, failed, or merged
- **THEN** status reports the exact task SHA, PR identity, current remote delivery state and safe next operation
- **AND** it does not push, create/merge PRs, update boards, clean worktrees, or change local main

#### Scenario: Remote merge is complete but local reconciliation is not

- **WHEN** GitHub reports the exact task PR as `MERGED` but the local integration copy has not yet been reconciled
- **THEN** status distinguishes `remote merged` from `local reconciliation pending`
- **AND** normal finish may complete only the already-supported serialized local reconciliation

### Requirement: Remote publication races converge idempotently

Repeated or concurrent platform-owned publication attempts for the same exact task head SHALL converge on the same remote PR and merge intent without requiring a lease that spans remote waits.

#### Scenario: Concurrent PR create race

- **GIVEN** two publishers target the same exact branch/base/head SHA
- **WHEN** one publisher creates the PR after both initially observed none
- **THEN** the other publisher re-queries and reuses that PR
- **AND** the create race does not produce competing task PRs

#### Scenario: Concurrent merge request race

- **GIVEN** two publishers target the same exact PR head A
- **WHEN** both request protected automatic integration
- **THEN** exact-head guards and current GitHub state make the operations convergent
- **AND** neither process may merge a different head

### Requirement: Native automatic-merge capability is visible and explicitly administered

For `harness_mode=platform` and `pr_merge_mode=auto`, platform diagnostics SHOULD report whether repository-native auto-merge / queue capability is available to persist the remote waiting step. Task publication SHALL NOT silently enable or disable repository-level auto-merge settings.

#### Scenario: Repository auto-merge is disabled

- **WHEN** automatic task publication is configured but native auto-merge/queue is unavailable
- **THEN** doctor/status reports the foreground fallback accurately
- **AND** may provide the explicit administrative action required to enable native auto-merge
- **AND** no repository setting is changed implicitly
